- [ ] `2 Piping Bags`
- [ ] `2 Baking Sheets` : `Lined With Greaseproof Parchment Paper`
- [ ] `Cake Stand`

## Preparation
1. Prepare the `Vanilla Pastry Cream`
2. Arrange 2 oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven
3. Add the `Water`, `Unsalted Butter`, `Salt` and `Granulated Sugar` to a pot
4. Bring the mixture to a boil while stirring with a wooden spoon to combine
5. Turn off the heat
6. Add all the `Plain Flour` to the pot and stir vigorously to combine into a ball around the wooden spoon
	- If a ball does not form almost immediately, hold the saucepan over low heat and stir vigorously for a few seconds until a ball forms
7. Transfer the dough to an Electric Mixer fitted with a paddle attachment
8. Beat the dough on **medium-high speed** for roughly **1 minute**
	- This will release any steam and cool the dough down
9. Once the dough has stopped releasing steam, add the `Eggs`
	- Stir to combine after adding each `Egg`
	- The resulting mixture should be smooth and glossy, but somewhat elastic
10. Add the mixture to a piping bag with a 1/2 inch tip
11. Pipe 4cm (1.5 inch) mounds of mixture onto two baking trays, lined with greaseproof parchment paper
	- When you reach the desired size, quickly twist and flick the piping bag so there is more of a flat top than a peak
	- Pipe 20 to 25 mounds of mixture per baking tray
12. Bake for **15 Minutes** at **230째C (450째F)**
13. Then, bake for **35 Minutes** at **175째C (350째F)**
	- Swap the trays half way through baking
14. Leave the resulting puffs to cool
15. Repeat Steps `11`-`14` until all the mixture is used up
16. While the puffs are baking, assemble a cone structure
	1. Roll a large sheet of thick paper into a cone
		- The cone should be 45cm (18 inch) long with a 15cm (6 inch) base diameter
	2. Cut off any excess at the bottom so it stands up like a party hat
	3. Place greaseproof parchment paper on the cake stand and grease with `Unsalted Butter`
	4. Place the cone on top of the greaseproof cake stand
17. Add the `Vanilla Pastry Cream` to a piping bag with a 1/3 inch tip
18. Use a small (paring) knife to poke a hole in the bottom of each puff
19. Insert the tip of the piping bag into the hole and squeeze until it feels heavy
	- Repeat with all the puffs
20. Prepare the `Caramel`
21. Dip the top of each puff in `Caramel` and place around the cone, starting at the base and building upwards like bricks in a wall
22. Once the tower is built, let the `Caramel` cool until strings form when you lift a fork up form it
23. Dip a fork in the `Caramel` and quickly swirl it around the croquembouche tower, creating a web of caramel strands
	- Repeat as much or as little as you like
24. Remove the greaseproof parchment paper from beneath the tower

> Serve Immediately
